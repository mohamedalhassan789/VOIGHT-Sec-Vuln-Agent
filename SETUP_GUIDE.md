```bash
cd C:\Projects\secvuln-agent
python src/setup.py
```

The wizard will guide you through all configuration options.

---

## üìã Configuration Options

### 1. Alert Mode

**Choose how you want to be alerted:**

#### Device-Only Mode (Recommended)
- ‚úÖ **Only alerts for CVEs affecting YOUR devices**
- Perfect for focused, actionable alerts
- Reduces noise - you only see what matters to your infrastructure
- **Use case**: "I only want to know about vulnerabilities in MY environment"

```yaml
filters:
  alert_mode: device-only
  min_cvss_devices: 4.0  # Alert for device CVEs with CVSS >= 4.0
```

**Example:**
- You have Apache 2.4.48 in devices.csv
- CVE-2024-1234 affects Apache 2.4.48 (CVSS 7.5)
- ‚úÖ **You get alerted** (affects your device)
- CVE-2024-5678 affects Nginx (CVSS 9.8)
- ‚ùå **No alert** (you don't use Nginx)

---

#### All CVEs Mode
- ‚úÖ **Alerts for critical CVEs + YOUR device CVEs**
- Stay informed about the broader threat landscape
- Good for security teams monitoring multiple environments
- **Use case**: "I want to know about major threats, even if they don't affect me yet"

```yaml
filters:
  alert_mode: all-cves
  min_cvss_devices: 4.0   # Device CVEs: CVSS >= 4.0
  min_cvss_all: 7.0        # Non-device CVEs: CVSS >= 7.0
```

**Example:**
- Your device CVE (CVSS 5.0): ‚úÖ Alert (>= 4.0 threshold)
- Other CVE (CVSS 8.5): ‚úÖ Alert (>= 7.0 threshold)
- Other CVE (CVSS 6.0): ‚ùå No alert (< 7.0 threshold)

---

### 2. Device Monitoring (Always Enabled)

**Your devices are monitored 24/7 automatically!**

```yaml
filters:
  min_cvss_devices: 4.0  # Set your comfort level
```

**Device monitoring includes:**
- ‚úÖ Continuous scanning for CVEs affecting your inventory
- ‚úÖ Matching by vendor, product, and version
- ‚úÖ Lower CVSS threshold (catch issues early)
- ‚úÖ Immediate alerts for critical device vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ Device breakdown in digest emails

**devices.csv Example:**
```csv
device_id,type,vendor,product,version,criticality,location
WEB-01,Server,Apache,HTTP Server,2.4.48,critical,DMZ
DB-01,Database,PostgreSQL,PostgreSQL,13.2,critical,Internal
FW-01,Firewall,Palo Alto,PAN-OS,10.1.3,critical,Edge
```

**When a CVE is found:**
```
üö® CVE-2024-1234 (CVSS 7.5) - HIGH
Affects: WEB-01, WEB-02 (Apache HTTP Server 2.4.48)
Action Required: Immediate patching recommended
```

---

### 3. Notification Frequency

**Choose how often you want to receive notifications:**

#### Option 1: Immediate Alerts Only
```yaml
notifications:
  schedule:
    frequency: immediate-only
    immediate_alerts: true
    digest_summary: false
```

- Real-time notifications when critical CVEs are found
- No daily digest emails
- **Best for**: Critical systems requiring immediate action

---

#### Option 2: Daily Digest Only
```yaml
notifications:
  schedule:
    frequency: digest-only
    immediate_alerts: false
    digest_summary: true
```

- One comprehensive email/message per day
- All CVEs summarized with statistics
- **Best for**: Regular monitoring without interruptions

---

#### Option 3: Both (Recommended)
```yaml
notifications:
  schedule:
    frequency: both
    immediate_alerts: true
    digest_summary: true
```

- Immediate alerts for critical issues
- Daily digest for comprehensive overview
- **Best for**: Maximum awareness with actionable urgency

---

### 4. Scan Interval

**How often should the agent check for new vulnerabilities?**

```yaml
agent:
  interval_hours: 6  # Options: 1, 2, 6, 12, 24
```

**Recommendations:**
- **Production servers**: 1-2 hours (maximum protection)
- **Standard environments**: 6 hours (balanced)
- **Development/testing**: 12-24 hours (less frequent)

**Note**: Scans are lightweight and won't impact system performance.

---

### 5. Immediate Alert Thresholds

**What triggers an immediate alert?**

```yaml
filters:
  immediate_alert_cvss: 9.0     # CVSS threshold for immediate alerts
  alert_on_cisa_kev: true       # Alert for CISA KEV vulnerabilities
  alert_on_exploit: true        # Alert for CVEs with public exploits
```

**Immediate alerts are triggered when:**
1. **CVSS >= threshold** (e.g., 9.0 for CRITICAL)
2. **In CISA KEV catalog** (actively exploited in the wild)
3. **Has public exploit** AND CVSS >= 7.0

**Example Alert Logic:**
```
CVE-2024-1234: CVSS 9.8              ‚Üí ‚úÖ Immediate alert (>= 9.0)
CVE-2024-5678: CVSS 7.5, CISA KEV    ‚Üí ‚úÖ Immediate alert (KEV)
CVE-2024-9012: CVSS 7.8, Exploit     ‚Üí ‚úÖ Immediate alert (Exploit)
CVE-2024-3456: CVSS 8.0, No exploit  ‚Üí ‚ùå Digest only (< 9.0, not KEV)
```

---

## üìä Configuration Examples

### Example 1: Small Business (Device-Only, Focused)
```yaml
agent:
  interval_hours: 6

filters:
  alert_mode: device-only
  min_cvss_devices: 5.0        # Only medium+ severity for devices
  immediate_alert_cvss: 8.0    # High severity immediate alerts
  alert_on_cisa_kev: true
  alert_on_exploit: true

notifications:
  schedule:
    frequency: both
```

**Result:**
- Checks every 6 hours
- Only alerts for CVEs affecting your devices (CVSS >= 5.0)
- Immediate alerts for CVSS >= 8.0, CISA KEV, or exploits
- Daily digest + immediate critical alerts

---

### Example 2: Enterprise Security Team (All CVEs, Maximum Awareness)
```yaml
agent:
  interval_hours: 1

filters:
  alert_mode: all-cves
  min_cvss_devices: 4.0        # Low threshold for our devices
  min_cvss_all: 7.0            # High threshold for others
  immediate_alert_cvss: 9.0    # Only critical immediate alerts
  alert_on_cisa_kev: true
  alert_on_exploit: false      # Too many false positives

notifications:
  schedule:
    frequency: both
```

**Result:**
- Checks every hour (rapid response)
- Device CVEs >= 4.0, all CVEs >= 7.0
- Immediate alerts for CVSS >= 9.0 or CISA KEV only
- Comprehensive daily digest

---

### Example 3: Development Environment (Digest Only, Less Frequent)
```yaml
agent:
  interval_hours: 24

filters:
  alert_mode: device-only
  min_cvss_devices: 7.0        # Only high severity
  immediate_alert_cvss: 10.0   # Effectively disabled

notifications:
  schedule:
    frequency: digest-only
```

**Result:**
- Checks once daily
- Only device CVEs with CVSS >= 7.0
- No immediate alerts (effectively disabled with 10.0 threshold)
- Single daily summary

## üñ•Ô∏è Device Monitoring Details

### How Device Matching Works

The agent matches CVEs to your devices using:

1. **Vendor/Product matching** (e.g., "Apache HTTP Server")
2. **Version comparison** (exact or range matching)
3. **CPE (Common Platform Enumeration)** matching

**Example:**
```csv
# devices.csv
device_id,vendor,product,version
WEB-01,Apache,HTTP Server,2.4.48
```

**CVE matches when:**
- Vendor = "Apache"
- Product = "HTTP Server" OR "Apache HTTP Server"
- Version = 2.4.48 OR version range includes 2.4.48

### Updating Devices

**To add/remove devices:**

1. Edit `config/devices.csv`
2. Save the file
3. Changes take effect on the next scan (automatic)
4. No need to restart the agent!

**Device CSV Format:**
```csv
device_id,type,vendor,product,version,criticality,location,notes
WEB-01,Server,Apache,HTTP Server,2.4.48,critical,DMZ,Production web server
DB-01,Database,PostgreSQL,PostgreSQL,13.2,critical,Internal,Main database
SWITCH-01,Network,Cisco,IOS,15.2,high,Core,Core switch
```

**Required Fields:**
- `device_id`: Unique identifier
- `vendor`: Vendor name
- `product`: Product name
- `version`: Software/firmware version

**Optional Fields:**
- `type`: Device type (Server, Database, Firewall, etc.)
- `criticality`: critical, high, medium, low
- `location`: Physical/logical location
- `notes`: Additional information
